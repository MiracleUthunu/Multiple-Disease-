Multple Disease Prediction
Overview: This project aims to predict the likelihood of an individual having multiple diseases based on their medical history, genetic predisposition, lifestyle factors, and demographic information. By analyzing these factors collectively, the system provides valuable insights for early disease detection and prevention.

Dataset
The dataset comprises anonymized patient records, including medical history, genetic markers, lifestyle habits, and disease diagnoses. Each record is labeled with the presence or absence of multiple diseases.

Prediction Model
We utilize machine learning techniques, such as ensemble methods, classification algorithms, to develop a robust predictive model. This model considers the interplay of various factors to accurately predict the probability of multiple diseases.

Usage
Data Preprocessing: Clean and preprocess the dataset to extract relevant features and normalize data.
Model Training: Train the prediction model using the preprocessed dataset.
Evaluation: Assess the model's performance using appropriate evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision.

Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow or PyTorch
Scikit-learn
Pandas
NumPy
